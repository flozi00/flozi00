### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Florian Zimmermeister and I come from a small town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

I am passionate about speech recognition, both to provide more accessibility for people with disabilities and to make the value of data available to everyone by making it high quality transcribed, translated and searchable. For this, I train open models, work on training algorithms and datasets. 
I love working with the huggingface ecosystem and discussing about crazy ideas for the open source world.

Two project i decided to publish are atra (speech recognition focused project) and simplepeft (allow training large models on small hardware with no AI knowledge)

Other open source contributions:

 - As of today (03/21/2023), I am one of the top 20 most active listeners and top 50 most active speakers for the German Commonvoice dataset.
 - As of today (11.05.2023) I am in the global Top 100 data collectors in the open assistant project.
